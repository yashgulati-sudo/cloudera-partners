## Useful to begin with Cloudera's stack primarily for:
* **Proof of Concept (PoC) and demo Deployments** – Quickly showcase Cloudera’s capabilities to customers.
* **Software Integration** – Develop and test integrations with Cloudera’s platform (excluding performance validation and high availability testing).
* **Internal Testing & Development** – Experiment with configurations before full-scale deployment.
* **Hands-On Learning** – Gain practical experience with Cloudera’s capabilities.

## Setup Options
### Deploying on fresh set of VMs

Spin up new VMs on-premises or on AWS (or any other cloud, !!!not tested yet) and set up a Cloudera cluster. 

**Pre-requisites** 

* Cloudera License – Log in to our https://cloudera-portal.force.com/clouderapartners[partner portal] to obtain the Cloudera on-premises license if you don’t already have one.

**Installation Instructions**

## Hardware Recommendation

You may experiment with lighter instances, particularly if your Cloudera deployment stack includes only a few services.

---

## Common Issues and Troubleshooting
* User file & directory permission issues - set umask to `022`.
* RHEL system registration issues - refer to https://access.redhat.com/solutions/253273[this] article for assistance.
* Unauthorized (HTTP 403) to download Cloudera parcels - ensure you've added your **active** Cloudera license.
* Insufficient AWS quota - Make sure you have enough AWS resources available for this setup. Example: if only specific number of resources are allowed in a category and all are in use, either clean up unused resources or request a quota increase.
